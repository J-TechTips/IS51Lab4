This program allows a user three tries to guesss the correct answer to the question
question = "What is the capital of California". The answer is "Sacramento"

We first set max_tries = 3. Then we creates a loop iterate three times. for each iteration,
we ask the user for the answer (user input). Then based on the answer the user gives, we 
check to see if the user input matches the answer. If so, print "correct!" , then terminate the 
loop with a break statement 

if the user coudl not guess the correct answe within the max_tries, then print
"You have used up your allotment of guesses.", then print "The correct answer is California"
